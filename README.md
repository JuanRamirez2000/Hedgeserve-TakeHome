# Hedgeserv

This project was meant to demonstratew programming skills using the AngularJS framework

## Task

The task at hand was to create a simple calculator using Angular with these restrictions/specifications

- The calculator has to have the minimum functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- No CSS libraries. Only using CSS or SCSS
- The app should demonstrate understanding of the primary Angular building blocks:
    - Router
    - Component
    - Service
- Bonus points for an API/Backend written in Typescript
- Additional add-ons (not specified on the test document):
    - Inclusion of unit tests

## App features

These are the features currently implemented in the app

- Basic calculator functions such as:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division

- NodeJS + ExpressJS backend to handle calculations

## How to run

### Before running app

1. Insure that all npm packages required are installed by running `npm install` within the `/api` and root directories
### Once all packages are installed
